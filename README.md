# MIST_C64
FPGA implementation of a Commodore 64

Please forgive the dodgy coding as this was a work in progress and also my first verilog/vhdl coding experience.....

The cartridge code was a simple redirection of the address bus....

There are glaring problems with the source which i was in the progress of trying to solve, I suspect the CIA to be at fault and this fails most of the VICE CIA test programs....
